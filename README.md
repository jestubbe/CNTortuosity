# CNTortuosity
The code performs Fourier component analysis, inspired by the [FIJI Directionality](https://github.com/fiji/Directionality) plugin. We use it to analyze SEM images of vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays and estimate the length/height ratio of CNT bundles. It preprocesses the image, calculates Fourier components, and computes the length/height ratio from the directional densities.
