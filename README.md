# py_directionality
The code performs Fourier component analysis, based on the FIJI Directionality plugin. We use it to analyze SEM images of vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays and estimate the length/height ratio of CNT bundles. It preprocesses the image, calculates Fourier components, and computes the length/height ratio from the directional densities.
